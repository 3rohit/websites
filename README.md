There are so many good developer sites, just like a sea.

# websites
Collection of web sites that web developer should know. [Click Me](http://gyf1.com/websites)

# background
There are already existed some awesome collections, like [js-the-right-way](http://jstherightway.org/) and so on.

However, I want to do some stuff more like bookmarks for web developers.
